# Celebrating ABP's DDD: A Decade Dedicated to Development

Today is not just another day. Today, we celebrate a decade of dedication, innovation, and collaboration.
10 years ago, the seeds of a vision were sown with the first commit to the [open-source ASP.NET Boilerplate project](https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate). As we stand at this significant milestone, let's take a moment to reflect on our journey.

Today isn't just another day. It's a day that holds a special place in our hearts. A day that reminds us of the late nights, the brainstorming sessions, the challenges faced, and the solutions found. A decade ago, we started with a simple idea: to make web application development easier and more efficient. This idea wasn't just a fleeting thought; it was a commitment to every developer out there. That commitment was materialized in the form of ASP.NET Boilerplate. As we stand at this 10-year mark, it's not just about looking back but also realizing how every step, every feedback, and every update has shaped our journey.
