# GetApp Category Leader

GetApp's Category Leaders methodology, effective from April 2020, ranks top North American software products based on end-user ratings in five key areas: ease of use, value for money, functionality, customer support, and likelihood to recommend. The evaluation involves a comprehensive analysis of potentially hundreds of products in a category, with only those scoring highest in these areas being named Category Leaders. These scores are derived from user reviews, public data, and vendor information, normalized for recency and volume, and then scaled to a maximum of 20 points per dimension, culminating in a total maximum score of 100. Inclusion criteria require products to have at least 20 unique reviews within 24 months and demonstrate essential functionality and relevance to a broad range of industries, ensuring both established and emerging vendors are considered. The final ranking is represented visually through radar charts, comparing each product's performance against the category average, with ties in scores resolved alphabetically.

# Software Advice Front Runners

Software Advice's FrontRunners methodology, updated in May 2020, evaluates software products using user reviews to score them on Usability and Customer Satisfaction. These scores are based on data from user reviews, public sources, and vendor information. To qualify, products must have at least 20 unique reviews within 24 months, demonstrating a broad appeal and functionality, and cater to North American users. The Usability score combines user ratings on functionality and ease-of-use, each accounting for half of the score. Customer Satisfaction is assessed through value for money, likelihood to recommend, and customer support ratings, with the latter having a higher weight. All ratings are converted to a standard 5-point scale, normalized for recency and volume, and then scaled up to 100. Products must meet a minimum score threshold on both axes, with a cap on the number of FrontRunners to ensure only the top 10 to 25 products per category are included, and no product scoring below 60 in either dimension is featured. The final FrontRunners graphic positions products based on their scores in these two key dimensions.
