As ABP.IO team, we just got back from our amazing trip with NDC London and would love to share a recap of this amazing conference. It was the 5th time in a row we were a proud sponsor of NDC London. It, now, basically feels like home spending 3 days in Queen Elizabeth Centre II with NDC London for the ABP.IO team to be there.

This year, we were there with Lead Developers of ABP.IO Platform Halil Ibrahim Kalkan and Alper Ebicoglu -as usual- and also ABP.IO Core team members, Engincan Veske and Bige Besikci Yaman.

These 3-days with the team was all about chatting and having fun with amazing attendees and speakers. We met with talented and passionate software developers and introduced the open source ABP Framework - web application framework built on ASP.NET Core and ABP Commercial - the complete web application development platform built on open source ABP Framework to them. We also had a chance to reunite with some of the regulars as us and talked about the latest updates on .NET and ABP.IO Platform.

We love to show our hospitality with hand-made chocolates; enjoy the small-but-useful gadgets as well as the beneficial items such as books and of course the funny stickers. This year was no different. We had delicious hand-made chocolates we brought all the way to London as always and didn't forget to enjoy them as we go through the days!

As for the benefits and efficiency, we gave Implementing DDD e-book written by the Lead Architecture of ABP Framework - Halil Ibrahim Kalkan to the .NET developers. Because, what better gift than a book?
