ABP.IO is a comprehensive platform that includes the open-source ABP Framework based on ASP.NET Core and its commercial solution designed on the .NET ecosystem. ABP.IO's purpose is to providing a robust infrastructure for developers to create modern web applications efficiently. As ABP.IO Core Team, we came til this day and excited for the upcoming days thanks to the ever expanding ABP Community members.

We are grateful for ABP Community including the team members who put effort into making ABP what it is today and the community members for all their amazing support. We, as ABP, achieved great successes in 2023 with and thanks to all of you by remaining our principals of being transparent and committed to our values for trying to help the developers build their web application efficiently with ABP Framework based on ASP.NET Core.

We will look into ABP.IO Platform 2023 milestones and wrap the year up in this blog post. Before we hop on to the ABP's recap, we'd like to mention the major highlights in .NET ecosystem which is the release of .NET 8.

##Â Events
We give a significant importance on giving back .NET and overall software development industry. This year was our most active year in the events part of it, because, we not only sponsored to events this year but also **organized** one.
* **[ABP .NET Conf'23](https://abp.io/conference/2023)** ABP .NET Conference 2023 took place online on May 10, 2023 and each talk is published in [ABP DOTNET Conf'23 Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsNclT2aHJcPTA3D4fIF10fsbhbckEbBC) publicly available on YouTube. Anyone was invited in the event as we mentioned in our [You Are Invited to ABP .NET Conf'23!](https://blog.abp.io/abp/You-Are-Invited-to-ABP-dotNET-Conf23) along with our excitement. It was a truly remarkable experience we got to taste for the first time and got a significant interest. You can read all the statistics in [ABP .NET Conference 2023 Wrap Up](https://blog.abp.io/abp/ABP-.NET-Conference-2023-Wrap-Up) along with our gratitude! ðŸ™‚
